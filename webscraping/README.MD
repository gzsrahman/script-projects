Web Scraping Instructions
===
I wanted to use this folder to showcase what I learned in my recent data analysis class.

You can run the script simply by downloading the file, navigating to the appropriate directory in terminal, and running:
>python3 webscraping.py

This python script goes to the transcript website for CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 show.
From there, it scrapes the HTML for the links to the most recent 5 transcripts.
Afterwards, it scrapes the HTML from the linked websites for the text information.
If you'd like to see the actual text, I welcome you to check the comments inside the file for instructions

After scraping textual information, the program also scrapes image files.
It finds and processes the image links for World Leaders on Wikipedia. From there, it sets up to download the files to your computer.
I assume you don't want random pictures of world leaders on your device; if you do I welcome you to check the comments inside again for instructions
